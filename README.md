In this project I utilized SQL, Node.js, HTML, CSS to create an online earthquake relief petition which lets users enter their email address to raise awareness for more donations and relief for people in the earthquake hit areas of Southern TÃ¼rkiye and Northern Syria. 

The email addresses inputted by the users are stored in a MySQL database, the number of people signed-up for the petition is continuously updated and displayed on the online web application.
